# vision-board

Created to help me plan my week and to motivate me to do important, but boaring, things. In the first screen you add a picture that gives you motivation. In the next screen you add tasks to different days. Every task give different amount of points. With the points you can by rewards. In the last screen you add rewards and the cost of the reward.
